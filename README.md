# Constrained-Longest-Common-Sub-sequences-using-Dynamic-Programming
My project of "Design and Analysis of Algorithms"  using efficient algorithms to find the Longest Common Sub-Sequences and Constrained Longest Common Sub-Sequences (String Inclusion and Constraint Inclusion). The best way to od it was with Dynamic Programming and then few alterations I used a research paper and then Implemented the Algorithm provided in it. Testify it with 1000+ different Inputs.
*It had been a good experience for me Learning Dynamic Programming and then its real life Applicational Implementation*
"Uses:"
1. Commonly used for string Matching
2. Used in Bio Labs for DNA Matching
3. Finding Minimal Changes required to alter a string
And many more
